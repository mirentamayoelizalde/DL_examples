# DL_examples
This repository includes examples of neural networks and convolutional neural networks algorithms for classification problems, and an example of a convolutional autoencoder for dimensionality reduction.

## Links to the notebooks
  * [Convolutional autoencoder](https://github.com/mirentamayoelizalde/DL_examples/blob/main/Convolutional_AutoEncoder.ipynb)
      - Test the number of latent space dimensions and get the minimum representation size with which an image could be properly reconstructed.
      - This script was written during the 2021 Neuromatch Academy Deep Learning course.
      - [Project presentation] (https://github.com/mirentamayoelizalde/DL_examples/blob/main/Convolutional_okapis_abstract_NMA_DL_2021.pptx)
  * [NN for image classification](https://github.com/mirentamayoelizalde/DL_examples/blob/main/Deep_NN_cat_noncat_images.ipynb)
     - Build a deep NN for image classification (cat vs non-cat).
     - From Coursera's Deep Learning Specialisation (DeepLearning.AI, Andrew Ng), Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
  * [NN for Fashion MNIST  classification](https://github.com/mirentamayoelizalde/DL_examples/blob/main/NNs_fashion_MNIST.ipynb)
     - Fashion MNIST dataset classification
  * [NN for hand-written digit (MNIST) classification](https://github.com/mirentamayoelizalde/DL_examples/blob/main/NNs_MNIST.ipynb)
     - NN for hand-written digit (MNIST) classification - To compare with CNN example
  * [CNNs for hand-written digit (MNIST) classification](https://github.com/mirentamayoelizalde/DL_examples/blob/main/CNNs_MNIST.ipynb)
     - CNNs, by preserving the locality of the pixels, find much better features in the images to predict from than NNs.
  * [CNN for CIFAR10 classification](https://github.com/mirentamayoelizalde/DL_examples/blob/main/CNNs_CIFAR10.ipynb)
     - CNN to classify images from the CIFAR10 dataset.
